'''
Kingâ€™s Island needs a program for its admission booths. When visitors to the
park come up to the booth to purchase their tickets, the worker uses this
program to figure out how much to charge them.

Each ticket cost $30. Senior citizens (age >= 65) are given a 50% discount.
Children under (or equal to) the age of 5 get a free admission.
Write a program that prompts for the visitor's age and computes the
ticket price (which should be a float).
'''

age = int(input("Input age: ")) # Do not change this line

# Fill in the missing code below
Ticket = (30 * 0.5)

if age >= 65:
    print("Ticket costs:$",Ticket)
elif age <= 5:
    print("Ticket costs:$",Ticket * 0)
else:
    print("Ticket costs:$",(Ticket * 2))
